h1. Polyglot

Polyglot makes it easy to use HAML,SASS, & Coffeescript in projects where you can't use them directly. Simply clone the repo, run "rake: watch", place your haml/sass files in the source directory and Polyglot will automagically turn them into html/css in the public directory.

Javascript minification coming soon.
